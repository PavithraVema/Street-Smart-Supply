🚀 Excited to share our journey at Tutedude’s Web Development Hackathon 1.0! 🎯

Our team took on the open-ended challenge:
“In India, street food vendors struggle to source raw materials from trusted and affordable suppliers.” 🌾🍅🥕

After researching real-world vendor pain points, we built StreetSmart Vendor – a web-based platform to help street food sellers connect with verified, cost-effective raw material suppliers.

✨ Key features:

🔍 Search & compare nearby suppliers

✅ Verified vendor ratings and trust scores

💬 Real-time inquiry and order system

📍 Location-based suggestions to minimize logistics
🧑‍🍳 Whether it’s a local samosa stall or a dosa vendor, our goal is to make their backend supply chain as smart and reliable as the food they serve on the frontlines.
